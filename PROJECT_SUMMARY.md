- **Build Time**: 58ms
- **API Response**: 55-266ms

## 🧪 Testing Results

All CRUD operations tested and verified:

### ✅ CREATE Operation
- Added 6 items successfully: Fabric ($150.50), Lace ($75.25), Brooch ($25.00), Fur ($200.00), Labour ($100.00), Extra ($50.00)
- Validation working: Empty names and negative prices rejected

### ✅ READ Operation
