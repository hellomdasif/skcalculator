## üß™ Testing

### Local Testing (Already Completed)

Server is running at: `http://localhost:8888`

**Tested Operations:**
1. ‚úÖ Database Connection - Connected to remote MySQL successfully
2. ‚úÖ Table Creation - `items` table created automatically
3. ‚úÖ Add Items - Added 6 test items (Fabric, Lace, Brooch, Fur, Labour, Extra)
4. ‚úÖ Fetch Items - Retrieved all items from database
5. ‚úÖ Delete Item - Deleted Brooch (ID: 3)
6. ‚úÖ Validation - Empty name and negative price validation working
7. ‚úÖ Production Build - Bundle created successfully (10.3 KB)

### Test After Deployment

1. Open your Netlify URL
2. Add a test item (e.g., "Test Item", $99.99)
3. Verify it appears in the items list
4. Build an invoice by entering quantities
5. Verify total calculation is correct
6. Delete the test item
7. Test on mobile device for responsiveness

## üì± Mobile Testing

The app is built with mobile-first design:
- Touch-friendly buttons (44px minimum height)
- Responsive layout (works on phones, tablets, desktop)
- No zoom on iOS (font-size: 16px on inputs)
- Optimized for small screens

Test on:
- iPhone Safari
- Android Chrome
- iPad
- Desktop browsers

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Errors
- Verify environment variables are set correctly in Netlify Dashboard
- Check database credentials are correct
- Ensure database host allows remote connections

### Build Errors
- Check Netlify build logs
- Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Ensure `netlify.toml` configuration is correct

### Functions Not Working
- Check function logs in Netlify Dashboard: Functions ‚Üí Select function ‚Üí Logs
- Verify environment variables are available to functions
- Check CORS headers are set correctly

## üìä Performance

**Production Bundle Size:**
- HTML: 1.95 KB (gzipped: 0.75 KB)
- CSS: 4.01 KB (gzipped: 1.32 KB)
- JS: 4.31 KB (gzipped: 1.73 KB)
- **Total: 10.3 KB (gzipped: 3.8 KB)**

**API Response Times (Local):**
- Database connection: ~220ms (first request)
- Subsequent requests: ~55ms
- Build time: 58ms

## üéâ Next Steps

1. Deploy to Netlify using the guide above
2. Test all features on production URL
3. Bookmark the URL on your mobile device for quick access
4. Start using it for your tailoring business!

## üìù Notes

- This is a personal app with no authentication
- Database credentials are stored as environment variables
- The app auto-creates the `items` table on first API call
- All invoice calculations happen client-side for instant results
